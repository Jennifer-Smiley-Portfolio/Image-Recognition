AI Image Recognition Project

Using the package ImageAI to learn and train the model. 

Unfortunatly the data files are too large to put into GitHub.
Here is the link to the data files, https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition. 

From there each flower group was split into a test folder and a train folder. I.e. Daisy-test, Daisy-train, etc.

Each flower is producing very high levels of accuracy, except for the dandelion which is only showing a 55% accuracy score. 
All the other flowers are producing recognition scores around 99% accuracy.
